[big]*i.     Abstract*

A single I3S data set, referred to as a Scene Layer, is a container for arbitrarily large amounts of heterogeneously distributed 3D geographic data. Scene Layers are designed to be used in mobile, desktop, and server-based workflows and can be accessed over the web or as local files. 

The delivery format and persistence model for Scene Layers, referred to as Indexed 3d Scene Layer (I3S) and Scene Layer Package (SLPK) respectively, are specified in detail in this OGC Community Standard. Both formats are encoded using JSON and binary ArrayBuffers (ECMAScript 2015). I3S is designed to be cloud, web and mobile friendly. I3S is based on JSON, REST and modern web standards and is easy to handle, efficiently parse and render by Web and Mobile Clients. I3S is designed to stream large 3d datasets and is designed for performance and scalability. I3S is designed to support 3D geospatial content and supports the requisite coordinate reference systems and height models in conjunction with a rich set of layer types.

The majority of the content in this OGC document is a direct copy of the content contained at https://github.com/Esri/i3s-spec . No normative changes have been made to the content. This OGC document does contain content not contained at https://github.com/Esri/i3s-spec.

However, there is a plan to incorporate the Terms and Definitions and References sections into the community GitHub repository.

Please note that the Esri I3S Github repository includes a “Building Scene Layer (e.g. comprehensive building model including building components)”. This layer type is not included in this Community Standard but may be included in a future version.

[big]*v.   Preface*

I3S originated from investigations into technologies for rapidly streaming and distributing large volumes of 3D content across enterprise systems that may consist of server components, cloud hosted components, and a variety of client software from desktop to web and mobile applications.

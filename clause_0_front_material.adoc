[big]*i.     Abstract*

This OGC Abstract Specification defines 1.) a conceptual model for tiling space and 2.) a logical model for 2-D tiled structures and by extension tiling. The conceptual model specified in this Abstract Specification could be a sub-class in a more comprehensive Spatial Partitioning Conceptual Model.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

Numerous OGC standards specify some type of tiling scheme. These include Web map Tiling Service (WMTS), CDB, and GeoPackage. There have also been a number of OGC Innovation Initiatives focused on tiling and tiling schemes. However, a general tiling conceptual model and related logical model for 2-D  Euclidian space have not been defined. This Abstract Specification defines a tiling conceptual model and a logical model for tiling 2-D planar space that is based on the conceptual model.

== Supported I3S Layer Structures
This section provides detailed information on the supported I3S layer structures for:

-	Point Scene Layer
-	Integrated Scene Mesh Layer
-	3D Object Scene Layer
-	Point Cloud Scene Layer

Profiles of the mandatory classes that define the layer are provided in a corresponding annex.

=== Point Scene Layer
Point scene layers contain point features and their attributes. Point scene layers are often used to visualize large amounts of 3D data like trees or buildings. Most phenomena that can be visualized by 3D symbols can be displayed with a point scene layers.

====	Point Scene Layer Structure
Point scene layers contain point features and their attributes. Point scene layers are often used to visualize large amounts of 3D data like trees or buildings. Most phenomena that can be visualized by 3D symbols can be displayed with a point scene layers.
The point scene layer is structured into a tree of multiple JSON files. Besides storing information in the JSON format, some are also provided as binary buffer. Point scene layers can be used to create a scene layer package (*.slpk) or an I3S service. A point scene layer _SHALL_ contain profiles of the following classes:

-	Layer description
-	Nodes containing Geometry and Attributes
-	Node Index Document
-	Statistics

Please visit Annex G for details on the Point Scene Layer Profile as well as a full JSON example.

=== Integrated Mesh Scene Layer

Integrated mesh scene layers are generally created for citywide 3D mapping. Integrated mesh scene layers include an entire surface and cannot be restyled. Three-dimensional mesh data are typically captured by an automated process (e.g. drone) for constructing 3D objects out of large sets of overlapping imagery. The result integrates the original input image information as a textured mesh including 3D objects, such as buildings and trees, and elevation information.

=== 3D Object Scene Layer
A 3D object scene layer is used to visualize 3D objects. 3D object scene layers are often created from GIS data with attributes and explicitly modeled in 3D. These attributes allow definition queries to specify symbology and other properties in lieu of setting properties for each object individually. A 3D object scene layer can efficiently create and share just a few buildings or an entire city.

=== 9.4	Point Cloud Scene Layer
Point cloud scene layers are designed to quickly display large volumes of symbolized and filtered point cloud data. They are optimized for the displaying and sharing a variety of sensor data, including LiDAR.

Point cloud scene layers are scalable, which allows for efficiency when working with large datasets. While rendering very large point cloud datasets can be slow and limited by hardware, point cloud scene layers are efficient because they are rendered at an optimized point resolution for the specified area.

Point cloud scene layers also support caching attributes like RGB, Intensity, Flags, Class Code, Returns, User Data, Point Source ID, GPS Time, Scan Angle and Near Infrared. This allows client applications to update the symbology as well as query point information.

==== 9.4.1	Point Cloud Scene Layer Structure
The point cloud scene layer is structured into a tree of multiple JSON files. Besides storing information in the JSON format, some are also provided as binary buffer. Point cloud scene layers can be used to create a scene layer package (*.slpk) or a I3S service. Since an *.slpk file can contain millions of documents, an [SLPK hash table](slpk_hash_table.pcsl.md) improves performance when scanning the slpk. A point cloud scene layer contains the following:
•	Layer description 
•	Nodes containing Geometry and Attributes
•	Node pages
•	Statistics

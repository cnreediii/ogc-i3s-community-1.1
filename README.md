# OGC Abstract specification topic "Core Tiling Conceptual and Logical Model"

This GitHub repository contains a draft of an OGC Abstract Specification for a conceptual model for tiling/tiled structures. The document also specifies a core logical model for tiling 2d Euclidean space.

The content of this AS has evolved since early 2018 and is grounded in a number of past and current OGC innovation and standards  program initiatives including:

- OGC Web Map Tile Service Standard
- OGC Tile Matrix Set Standard
- OGC GeoPackage Standard
- OGC GeoPakage Tiled gridded coverage data extension
- OGC Vector Tiles Pilot
- OGC Testbed 14 activities
- The editors personal experience on this topic
- Various discussions and presentations at OGC Technical Committee meetings.

Please note that this Abstract Specification IS NOT a general discussion or model of a complete space/time partitioning model!

Please also note that this Abstract Specification DOES NOT address such topics as tile pyramids, layers, and symbology. These cocepts and the related logocal models are all extensions or profiles with extensions of this base Abstract Specification.

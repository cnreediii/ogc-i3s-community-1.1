== I3S File Formats

=== 8.1	Textures

The Textures file is a binary resource that contains one or multiple images that are used as textures of features in the store. 
A single Texture.bin file contains 1...n textures for a single specific texture LoD. It can contain a single texture atlas or 
multiple individual textures.  The bundling strategy is determined by the authoring application so that specific aspects of the 
materials and textures used can be taken into account, such as tiling.

==== 8.1.1	Texture Recommendations and Requirements
The number and volume of textures tends to be the limiting display factor, especially for web and mobile clients. Thus, this 
standard provides several recommendations and requirements on texture resources that are delivered as part of an Indexed 3D Scene.

==== 8.1.2	Image Formats
I3S supports multiple texture formats. The choice of format depends on the use case. For example, a client application might 
prefer consuming the more compact JPEG (and/or PNG) formats over low bandwidth conditions since they are very efficient to 
transmit and have a widespread adoption. However, client applications that might be constrained for memory or computing resource 
might prefer to directly consume compressed textures such as S3TC for scalability and performance reasons. 

As a result, the I3S standard supports most commonly used image formats such as JPEG/PNG as well as rendering optimized 
compressed texture formats such as S3TC. The only requirement is the authoring application needs to provide the appropriate 
`textureEncoding` declaration by using MIME types such as, “image/jpeg” (for Jpeg) and “image/vnd-ms.dds” (for S3TC).  

==== 8.1.3	Texture Sets
This standard allows the combination of multiple textures into a single resource by using array buffer views. However, we 
generally recommend using large atlases (e.g. 2048x2048px) and then to use exactly one texture per bundle.

==== 8.1.4	Atlas usage and Regions
Individual textures should be aggregated into texture atlases. Each individual texture becomes a subtexture. As with all texture 
resources, the atlas has to be 2n-sized on both dimensions, with n being in the range [3,12]. Width and height dimensions do not 
have to be equal, e.g. 512px x 256px. Subtextures contained within an atlas also need to be 2n-sized, with n being in the 
range [3,12]. Otherwise if their width or height dimension is not 2n, border artifacts are likely to appear when filtering or 
MIP-mapping. If source subtexture dimensions do not match this requirement, they need to be padded (with nearest/interpolated 
pixels) or scaled to the nearest lower 2n size. An image that is 140px x 90px would thus be rescaled to 128px x 64px before 
being inserted into the atlas or padded to 256px x 128px.

Subtexture pixels are identified by the `subimageRegion`: [`umin`, `vmin`, `umax`, `vmax`] attribute. Region information is 
passed on to the shader using a separate vertex attribute so that every vertex UV coordinate becomes a UVR coordinate, with 
the R encoding the [`umin`, `vmin`, `umax`, `vmax`] of the region in 4 UInt16 values. 

==== 8.1.5	Texture coordinates
Client capabilities for handling complex UV cases vary widely, so texture coordinates are used. Texture coordinates do not 
directly take atlas regions into account. They always range from 0...1 in U and V, except when using the "repeat" 
wrapping mode, where they may range from 0...n (n being the number of repeats). The client is expected to use the 
`subimageRegion` values and the texture coordinates to best handle repeating textures in atlases. This approach has been 
selected since client capabilities in dealing with more complex UV cases vary greatly.

==== 8.1.6	Generating Image IDs
The Id of an image is generated using the following method:

```
UInt64 BuildID(LONG id, int w, int h , int l, int al)
{
    UInt64 l_al = ((UInt64)al)<<60;
    UInt64 l_l = ((UInt64)l)<<56;
    UInt64 l_w = ((UInt64)(w - 1))<<44;
    UInt64 l_h = ((UInt64)(h - 1))<<32;
    UInt64 id64 = l_al + l_l + l_w + l_h + (UInt64)id;
    return id64;
}
Usage syntax: 
UInt64 image_id = BuildID(id, w, h, l, al); 
```

=== 8.2	Geometry
The binary geometry attribute file follows the Khronos http://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/[Typed Array specification] in the https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm[ECMAScript® 2015 Language Specification]. Citing the overview of that specification:

“This specification defines an ArrayBuffer type, representing a generic fixed-length binary buffer. The contents of an ArrayBuffer cannot be directly manipulated. Instead, a group of types are used to create views of the ArrayBuffer. For example, to access the buffer as an array of 32-bit signed integers, an Int32Array would be created that refers to the ArrayBuffer.
Multiple typed array views can refer to the same ArrayBuffer, of different types, lengths, and offsets. This allows for complex data structures to be built up in the ArrayBuffer. As an example, given the following code:

```
// create an 8-byte ArrayBuffer
var b = new ArrayBuffer(8);

// create a view v1 referring to b, of type Int32, starting at
// the default byte index (0) and extending until the end of the buffer
var v1 = new Int32Array(b);

// create a view v2 referring to b, of type Uint8, starting at
// byte index 2 and extending until the end of the buffer
var v2 = new Uint8Array(b, 2);

// create a view v3 referring to b, of type Int16, starting at
// byte index 2 and having a length of 2
var v3 = new Int16Array(b, 2, 2);
```

This defines an 8-byte buffer b, and three views of that buffer, v1, v2, and v3. Each of the views refers to the same buffer -- so v1[0] refers to bytes 0..3 as a signed 32-bit integer, v2[0] refers to byte 2 as a unsigned 8-bit integer, and v3[0] refers to bytes 2..3 as a signed 16-bit integer. Any modification to one view is immediately visible in the other: for example, after v2[0] = 0xff; v2[1] = 0xff; then v3[0] == -1 (where -1 is represented as 0xffff)."
